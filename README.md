# Stock-Dashboard---tableau

Imported last 5 years historical data for Google(GOOG), Microsoft(MSFT), Apple(APPL) using yahoo finance and downloaded them as csv.

UNION Joined three datasets.

# Formation of Candlestick

- Dragged Open and Low value into the row and date into the column, turned dual axis on and aligned the axis values.
- Made two calculated fields; High - Low & Close - Open as body of the candle stick = Close - Open and wick = High - Low.
- Dragged high - low into size of low and close - open into size of open.
- Dragged close - low into colour and set diverging red-green colour.
- Formatted the necessary adjustments for better visualization.

# Company Symbol Filter

- By default, we get only few symbols, now we update the symbols into the Tableau Repository folder and reload and place individual symbols next to their ticker.
